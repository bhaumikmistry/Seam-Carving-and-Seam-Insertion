# Seam-Carving-and-Seam-Insertion

• sir.m = Seam_Insertion_Reduction file
• energyRGB = used to find out the energy of the given image.

The Seam carving and seam insertin code is developed on the paper 'Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing by Shai Avidan'. 
The algorithm is described in the paper, the code is based and developed from the same. There are some parts which has been developed in 
different ways and the algorithm is different.

The above mentioned paper explains how you can make an image resize from both direction, but the given code is a bit different explained as follows.
1) It can either expand or reduce in one direction at a time.
2) It uses newly developed algorithm for insertion.
3) It can work for gray_scaled imagea as well as color_image.
